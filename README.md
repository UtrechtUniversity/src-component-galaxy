# Galaxy Server on SURF ResearchCloud

This repo provides the Ansible playbook for a [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) server component on SURF ResearchCloud (SRC) üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Also see the [official Galaxy training manual for SRC](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/surf-research-cloud-galaxy/tutorial.html).

### Prerequisites

* Assumes Nginx is already installed on the workspace via the SURF [Nginx component](https://gitlab.com/rsc-surf-nl/plugins/plugin-nginx).
* The official [Galaxy Ansible role](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy)
* The official [Galaxy postgres](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-postgresql) and [postgres_objects](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-postgresql-objects) roles for database management
* The official [Galaxy CVMFS role](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/cvmfs/tutorial.html) and [Apptainer](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/apptainer/tutorial.html) provided by the Galaxy community
* Assumes Nginx is already installed on the workspace (via the SURF Nginx component)
 
## Overview

### Services

* Postgres is installed on the same host as Galaxy.
* Galaxy is started the first time via `/usr/local/bin/galaxyctl start`. After that, it can be managed using `systemctl`, e.g. with `systemctl status galaxy.target`.
  * Galaxy runs on `localhost:8080`.
* An Nginx reverse proxy is started serving the Galaxy application on `https://<workspace_fqdn>`, providing SRAM authentication (see below).
  * Nginx proxies port 443 to localhost:8080
* If `src_galaxy_interactive_tools` is enabled, the [gx-it-proxy](https://github.com/galaxyproject/gx-it-proxy) application is started on port `8001`.
* If `src_galaxy_enable_tus`, [`tusd`](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/tus/tutorial.html) is started on port `8002`.

### Authentication

Galaxy is configured to let the webserver (Nginx) handle authentication. The webserver uses OpenID connect to authenticate against SRAM.

Any members of the workspace's Collaborative Organisation (CO) will be able to authenticate using the authentication mechanism of their institution (Single Sign-On).

Galaxy is configured such that members of the CO that are in the SRAM workspace admin group (`src_co_admin`) will be Galaxy administrator when logging in via SSH (`sudo` will require entering the user's SRAM TOTP). Other users are normal users.

Note: only members of the `src_co_admin` group are given permission to install tools on the Galaxy instance.

### Logging in via SSH

The Galaxy VM will be accessible via SSH for users in the Collaborative Organization. However, only users in the CO admin group 
(configured by the `src_galaxy_co_admin_group` parameter, default: `src_co_admin`) will be able to `sudo`.

The Galaxy application listening on localhost will expect a secret key in the request header that Nginx is configured to pass on when reverse proxying; as non-admin users
on the Galaxy machine won't have access to this secret key, they cannot directly query Galaxy on localhost.

### Connecting to Pulsar 

A Galaxy machine can be connected to Pulsar inside the SRC, following the [SRC component Pulsar](https://github.com/ErasmusMC-Bioinformatics/src-component-pulsar) instructions. 

### Usability of external storage

If you attach additional networked storage to the workspace, you can set `src_galaxy_storage_path` to a path on that storage volume. If your storage is e.g. called "galaxy storage", set the parameter to: `/data/galaxy_storage/datadir`. In theory, this should allow you to re-use datasets, tools, etc. from previous Galaxy workspaces.

## ResearchCloud parameters

The component takes the following parameters:

* `src_galaxy_version`: String. Set to e.g. `23.2` (default) to control the version of Galaxy that will be installed.
* `src_galaxy_api_exposed`: Boolean. if `true` (default), the `/api` route does not require authentication via Single Sign-On.
* `src_ibridges`: Boolean (default: `true`). Whether to enable support for the [iBridges](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/galaxy-tools-ibridges) tool for connecting to Yoda and iRODS instances. Implies `src_galaxy_bootstrap`, and adds iBridges to the list of tools to be installed automatically. To use the interactive iBridges tool, don't forget to enable interactive tools as well.
* `src_galaxy_jobs_default`: String. What runner to use for jobs by default. Valid values: `singularity`, `docker`, `local`. Default: `singularity`.
* `src_galaxy_interactive_tools`: if `true` (default), support for [interactive tools](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/special_topics/interactivetools.html) is enabled.
* `src_galaxy_co_admin_group`: String group corresponding to an SRAM group. Members of this SRAM group will be made Galaxy admin users.
* `src_galaxy_bootstrap`: Boolean. Also see [below](#bootstrapping). If `true` (default), will attempt to install workflows, dataproviders and tools as configured by the following options:
    * `src_galaxy_tool_files`: String of comma-separated paths to YAML files (in this repo) containing tool specifications.
    * `src_galaxy_workflow_files`: String of comma-separated paths to `.ga` files (in this repo) containing workflow specifications.
    * `src_galaxy_custom_repo`: String URL to a git repo containing workflow files (in the `workflows` dir of the root of the repo) and tool specification files (in the `tools` dir). Example repo: 
    * `src_galaxy_custom_repo_branch`: String branch of the custom repo to be used.
* `src_galaxy_storage_path`: String filepath. Default: `/srv/galaxy/datadir`. Path where Galaxy's "mutable data directory" will be located. If you attach additional networked storage to the workspace, you can set `src_galaxy_storage_path` to a path on that storage volume. If your storage is e.g. called "galaxy storage", set the parameter to: `/data/galaxy_storage/datadir`. In theory, this should allow you to re-use datasets, tools, etc. from previous Galaxy workspaces.
* `src_galaxy_enable_tus`: Boolean. If true, enable support for performant and resumable uploads using [tusd](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/tus/tutorial.html).
* `src_galaxy_cvmfs`: Boolean. If true, loads references data from [CVMFS](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/tutorials/cvmfs/tutorial.html).
* `src_galaxy_brand`: String. Brand name to display in the Galaxy webinterface.

## Bootstrapping

The `src_galaxy_bootstrap` parameter determines whether the Galaxy instance should be bootstrapped: that is, whether various tools, workflows, and datamanagers should be installed.
These can be installed from various sources:

* a git repo containing `.yml` files descibing which tools to install, and `.ga` workflows files
  * example repo here
  * put tool files in the `tools` subdirectory (as defined by the `_galaxy_custom_repo_tool_location` internal variable).
  * put workflow files in the `workflows` subdirectory (as defined by the `_galaxy_custom_repo_workflow_location` internal variable).
  * use `src_galaxy_custom_repo` and `src_galaxy_custom_repo_branch` to define your repository.
* any number of `.yml` tool files found in this repository
  * use `src_galaxy_tool_files` to provide these. For instance, you may set this parameter to `tools/ibridges.yml,tools/foo.yml` to install the tools defined in those locations.
  * see [here](tools/ibridges.yml) for an example
* any number of `.ga` workflow files found in this repository
  * use `src_galaxy_workflow_files` to provide these. For instance, you may set this parameter to `tools/bar.ga` to install that workflow.

By customizing the `src_galaxy_custom_repo`, `src_galaxy_tool_files` and `src_galaxy_workflow_files` parameters, you can thus create different 'flavours' for your Galaxy Catalog Item
that each contain different tools and workflows out of the box.

__Note__: workflow files installed using the bootstrapping procedure will be installed as `public` workflows available to all users on the Galaxy instance!
You can find these under `Data > Workflows` in Galaxy's main menu.

### Bootstrapping: how does it work?

If boostrapping is enabled, this Ansible playbook will:

1. Configure Galaxy to use a bootstrapping API key in `galaxy.conf`.
1. Restart Galaxy.

...and then invoke the [ansible-galaxy-tools role](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/ansible-galaxy-tools/) to do the following:

1. Use the bootstrapping API key to import tools.
1. Use the bootstrapping API key to create an admin user.
  * Use an API key belonging to the admin user to import workflows.

If needed Galaxy, is restarted. Finally, the playbook will __always__ remove the bootstrapping API key. 

## Interactive tools

Galaxy has support for so-called [interactive tools](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/special_topics/interactivetools.html), but it needs to be enabled. The `src_galaxy_interactive_tools` parameter controls whether they should be activated. At the moment, Galaxy interactive tools have to be run in Docker containers (AppTainer is not supported). So if `src_galaxy_interactive_tools` is set to `true`, the playbook does the following:

* Docker is installed
* Docker tools are enabled in `job_config.yml`
* A special Python script is used to determine whether a particular tool should be run as a Docker job.
  * any tools that are of the kind `'interactive'` are sent to Docker
  * __note__: this means that if an admin installs an interactive tool, it will automatically be configured *as* an interactive tool -- so admins should make sure that tools they install can securely be run as interactive tools.
  * other tools are sent to the default job destination (configured by `src_galaxy_jobs_default`)
  * see [templates/default_dispatch.py.j2]

__Note__: Galaxy supporst two kinds of interactive tools:

* subdomain-based: the interactive tool is made accessible on an ad-hoc created subdomain of the FQDN at which galaxy runs, e.g. `myinteractivetool12345.mygalaxy.com`
* [path-based](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/special_topics/interactivetools.html#path-based-interactivetools): the interactive tool is made accessible on a sub-path of the FQDN at which Galaxy runs, e.g. `mygalaxy.com/myinteractivetool12345`

Because we cannot acquire SSL certificates for a wildcard subdomain on ResearchCloud, this component only supports path-based interactive tools.

## Maintenance

You can stop/restart Galaxy using systemctl, e.g.: `<sudo> systemctl restart galaxy.target`. Use e.g. `<sudo> galaxyctl follow` to follow the logs of all Galaxy services.

## Testing

This repo contains [Molecule](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/) tests for the playbook. To run them, you'll need:

1. [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule/) installed
1. [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) installed
2. Access to the `ghcr.io/utrechtuniversity/src-test-workspace:ubuntu_jammy-nginx` container image
  * see: https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/SRC-test-workspace/pkgs/container/src-test-workspace
